# 10.1 INTRODUCTION
# 10.1 引言

A key question in attempts to distribute the rendering of a single image frame over a number of processing units is how to assign pixels to processing units. In the context of this chapter, we will use an abstract notion of a processing unit or processor. For example, a processor could be a GPU, a CPU core, or a host in a cluster of networked machines. A number of processors of various types will generally be combined into some form of rendering system or cluster.
将一帧图像的渲染过程分布到多个处理单元上的一个关键问题是，如何将大量像素分配给各个处理单元。在本章的语境中，我们会使用处理单元或处理器这样一种抽象的概念。例如，一个处理器可能是一个 GPU、一个 CPU 核、或连网的机器集群中的一台主机。不同类型的若干处理器常常结合在一起构成某种形式的渲染系统或集群。

This chapter is motivated by the workloads commonly found in path tracing renderers, which simulate the interaction of light with the materials in a scene. Light is often reflected and refracted multiple times before a light transport path is completed. The number of bounces, as well as the cost of evaluating each material, varies dramatically among different areas of a scene.
本章的启发来自于路径追踪渲染中常见的工作负载，即模拟光线与场景中的材料的相互作用。光线在结束其传播路径前往往会反射及折射若干次。在场景的不同区域中，光线反弹的次数以及各种材料相关的计算开销往往差异巨大。

Consider, for example, a car in an infinite environment dome. Rays that miss all geometry and immediately hit the environment are extremely cheap to compute. In contrast, rays that hit a headlight of the car will incur higher ray tracing costs and will bounce around the reflectors of the headlight dozens of times before reaching the emitters of the headlight or exiting to the environment. Pixels that cover the headlight may thus be orders of magnitude more costly to compute than pixels that show only the environment. Crucially, this cost is not known a priori and thus cannot be taken into account to compute the optimal distribution of work.
例如，设想一辆置于无限大的环境穹顶下的汽车。错过所有几何结构直接击中环境的光线是最容易计算的。相反，击中汽车前灯的光线将引发较高的光线追踪开销，这些光线在到达前灯的发射源或逃逸到环境中之前会围绕前灯的反射镜反弹数十次。因此，覆盖前灯的像素可能具有比直接显示环境的像素高几个数量级的开销。关键的是，这种开销无法提前预知，因而不能用于计算最优工作分布。
